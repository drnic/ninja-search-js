Ninja Search JS - the Greasemonkey Script
--------------------------------------

Description
===========

Do long drop down lists make you want to send out an assassin and hunt down web developers? Then I have the ninja for you.

Ninja Search JS - the Greasemonkey Script (aka ninja-search-js) converts all nasty, long drop down lists into autocompleteable text fields; and then then snap back into their drop down list form when you've selected an item.

See the [home page](http://drnic.github.com/ninja-search-js/) for more information, a demo, and the downloadable Greasemonkey/GreaseKit script.

Ok, let's put the [installer script here](http://drnic.github.com/ninja-search-js/dist/ninja-search.user.js) too.

The icon was original developed for the Cocoa application Ninja Search, for which the idea was adapted into a Greasemonkey script. So I kept the name and thus got to keep the cool icon :)
